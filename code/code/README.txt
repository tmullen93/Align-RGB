Some of these files were written by my professor Subhransu Maji as a part of a homework assignment.

The files written mostly by him:

alignChannels.m
alignProkudin.m
demosaicImage.m
evalAlignment.m
evalDemosaicing.m
mosaicImage.m
randomlyShiftChannels.m
runDemosaicing.m

(I edited these to run my programs)
